# Modeling Property Values in Cook County, IL
This is the U of Chicago Master-Track Module 4 project modeling property values in the Northern Triad of Cook County, IL (Chicago).

### Purpose & Objective
The Module 4 study is the fourth and final in a series of data modeling initiatives aimed at addressing three primary shortcomings identified in Civic Consulting Alliance's (CCA) third-party review of the property tax assessment process and outcomes of the Cook County Assessors Office (CCAO):

1. variability in assessment outcomes
2. valuation regressivity
3. overutilization of the assessment appeal process

Within this context, **the specific objective of the Module 4 study is to a identify a property valuation model(s) that outperforms CCAO's "first-pass" model as measured by coefficient of dispersion (COD).**  As further detailed below, COD directly measures the variability of assessment outcomes.
